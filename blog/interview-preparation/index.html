<p>It’s not an interview — it’s an exam. There is a right question to every answer! The game is to develop the right answer ahead of time to the questions you know you will be asked, and be able to present those answers during the interview. Here’s how to do this.</p>
<h2 id="general-tips">General tips</h2>
<p>Make your interviewer’s life easy. Make sure your answers are well-structured, well-reasoned, and easy to follow. Give something a little different, something memorable. Be someone they would want to have working for them. Demonstrate the skills in your answers as you describe them (attention to detail, good communication skills, strong work ethic etc.)</p>
<p>Talk about the pull factors of the job, not the push factors of everything else. They want someone who wants this job, not just someone who doesn’t want any other job. You want to work in public health because you want to address the upstream causes of poor health, not because you don’t like seeing patients.</p>
<p>Keep it personal and relevant to you and the job, not vague, generic answers. Make sure your answers are specific and your logic is strong. If your answer could also be used by someone applying for a different specialty, then it’s not as good as it could be. You want to work in public health because you’re interested in society-wide interventions, not because you like doing research. Even if the question is more general (what are your strengths), try and engineer an answer that is specific to your specialty. Then, you can give a reflection on why this answer (this strength, weakness, etc.) is what brought you to your interest in your specialty.</p>
<p>Learn your answers. Practice saying them out loud, again and again, until they roll off the tongue. It helps if you have someone to prepare with, as you can give constructive criticism to each other and refine your answers together.</p>
<p>Prepare for a curveball question. Every question can be boiled down to one of: Why are you right for this job, or, why is this job right for you. Decide which one the curveball is, and tailor a prepared answer to one of these questions to it.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-lists">Preparing lists</h2>
<p>List all of the questions you can imagine being asked by the examiner. I’ve included some classic questions below, but you might be able to think of some questions that are specific to your specialty as well.</p>
<p>List all of the things you want to tell the examiner about. You’re going to use these as evidence for your answers. Use things that will set you aside from the rest of the crowd, such an any achievements, awards, scholarships, particularly exciting pieces of work, and projects you’ve done that are relevant to the speciality.</p>
<p>Finally, take the person specification and pull out all of the qualities that are listed.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-answers">Preparing answers</h2>
<p><span style="background:cyan;">Answer the question.</span> Make sure you answer the question in your first sentence. Don’t start on a tangent and try to circle back to the answer later. You’ll have lost the interviewer by the time you actually get to the answer.</p>
<p><span style="background:magenta;">Follow a clear structure.</span> Make your interviewer’s life easier, and follow a clear structure in your answers. It lets them follow your reasoning more clearly, and it shows that you’ve put the work in and properly prepared. I’ve included two common structures below (STAR and SPIES). Find one that works for you.</p>
<p><span style="background:yellow;">Hit the person specification.</span> Your interviewer will have a list of positive and negative indicators on their marking scheme for this question, and usually, most of these will come directly from the person specification. Use the person spec to think about what the interviewer will want to hear and want to avoid, and structure your answer so that you hit as many positive indicators as possible and don’t hit any negative indicators. This is how you make sure your answer is the “right” one. If you don’t bear the person specification in mind, you won’t maximise your score.</p>
<p><span style="background:pink;">Give evidence for your answer.</span> Give weight to your answer by backing it up with something from your list. If you’re telling the interviewer that you want to do public health because of your interest in the social determinants of health, then back this up with an anecdote about how you worked closely with the social worker on your ward on a particular case and saw first hand how ill health can result from poor social circumstances.</p>
<p><span style="background:skyblue;">Explain the relevance.</span> Show how your answer makes you the right candidate for the job. Show that you’ve done your research and you know what the day-to-day work is like. Explain how your answer and evidence relate to the work.</p>
<p><span style="background:red;">Summarise and reflect.</span> Don’t let yourself just trail off. Make sure that you know how your answer is going to end. Signpost that you’ve finished talking by recapping your answer, and clearly end your answer.</p>

<p>What are your strengths?</p>
<div style="font-style:italic;">
<p><span style="background:cyan;">I’m someone who has excellent time management skills.</span> <span style="background:magenta;">Let me tell you about a time that I demonstrated this, and why this would make me a good registrar in public health.</span> <span style="background:yellow;">Last year, I led a group of junior doctors working on a research project on out-of-hour admissions in our hospital.</span> <span style="background:pink;">I had to balance my day-to-day work as an SHO with this project, leading the team and ensuring the work was done to the highest possible standard.</span> <span style="background:skyblue;">I know that public health is a specialty where I’ll be managing multiple projects at the same time, so balancing priorities and committments is an important skill here.</span> <span style="background:red;">In summary, my ability to organise my time and prioritise my work makes me a strong candidate for the training scheme.</span></p>
