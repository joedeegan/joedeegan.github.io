<h1 id="joe-deegan">Joe Deegan</h1>
<p>I am an Irish doctor working as a specialty registrar in public health medicine in the UK.</p>
<p>I’m interested in evaluation, operational research, and design thinking in healthcare. I completed my medical degree in Trinity College Dublin, and my MSc in Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.</p>
<p>I’m currently working as part of the public health team at Kent County Council.</p>
<p>Before this, I worked in acute medicine in St James’s Hospital, Dublin. I was the lead NCHD at St James’s Hospital in 2022-2023, and received a George Moore Scholarship from the Ireland’s Funds to study public health in London.</p>
<p>If you’d like to chat to me about my work or anything at all, please get in touch! You can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deeganjoe/">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://www.joedeegan.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>.</p>

<p>It’s always nice to get a fuller picture of someone than a CV can provide. Here’s a few things I’ve enjoyed over the last little while.</p>
<p>I’ve been listening to Lankum, Romy, Charli XCX, Bonnie Prince Billy, and the Nolan Sisters.</p>
<p>I’ve been reading Intermezzo by Sally Rooney, Say Nothing by Patrick Radden Keefe, and The Wren, The Wren by Anne Enright. I still haven’t been able to get Prophet Song by Paul Lynch out of my head.</p>
<p>The best movies I watched in 2024 were Challengers, Conclave, and American Fiction. (I also quite liked The Substance).</p>
